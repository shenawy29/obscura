# Obscura

Welcome to [**Obscura**](https://obscura.onrender.com/), a simple, lean, mean, hack.chat-like web app. Obscura is designed for privacy and simplicity: nothing you send is saved; everything is stored in-memory and disappears when you exit.

## Features

- **Channel-based communication**: Each channel is simply a URL. Share the URL with others to start chatting.
- **Ephemeral storage**: Messages are stored in memory only—once you leave, they’re gone forever.
- **Minimalist design**: Focus on communication without distractions.

## How It Works

1. Navigate to the Obscura website.
2. Enter a channel by appending `/channel-name` to the URL (e.g., `https://obscura.onrender.com/foo`) or by using the website's UI.
3. Share the URL with others to join the conversation.
4. Start chatting—no registration or data storage involved!

## Why Use Obscura?

- **Privacy-first**: No logs, no saved messages, and no user data storage.
- **Simple and lightweight**: No unnecessary features, just chatting.
- **Accessible**: Works on any modern browser without additional software.
